# hello-world


Hello Human kind,


I have always loved coding but I know little about it. 
I learned javascript a while ago but later on life got busy and coding went to the back.
Now, I want to get that habit back.
I love pizza (veggie) and am a lacto-ovo-vegetarian.
Go on google to find out what that means.
